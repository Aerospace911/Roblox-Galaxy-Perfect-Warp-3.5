# Roblox Galaxy Perfect Warp
With Yname's blessing, I now present to you, Perfect Warp 3.0. The legal version of Perfect Warp that I have developed in AHK, is a macro-scripting language. This script inputs the distance you want to warp, then it places a line over the warp bar indicating how far to charge warp for a Perfect Warp.


### NOTICE 
The script does not work out of the box. There is a setup required with the additional programs included.

# How to use the script in steps
1. [Download AHK v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
