# Roblox Galaxy Perfect Warp 3.5 (Legal Version)
With Yname's blessing, I now present to you, Perfect Warp 3.5. The legal version of Perfect Warp that I have developed in AHK. Which is a macro-scripting language. This script takes user input of the distance you want to warp, then it places a line over the warp bar indicating how far to charge warp for a Perfect Warp.

Perfect Auto Warps do exist however, I have chosen not to release them because it would make Yname unhappy.

### NOTICE 
The script does not work out of the box. There is a setup required with the additional programs included.

## Version Summary
Perfect Warp 1.0: Auto warp script with a very crude and rudimentary warp formula found using maptheformula.ahk.

Perfect Warp 2.0: Upgraded/Refined auto warp script from Perfect Warp 1.0 using maptheformula.ahk.

Perfect Warp 3.0: Manual warp script that derived its formula from how fast the warp charge bar measured in pixels per second using Mapthebar.ahk.

Perfect Warp 3.5: Manual warp script based on Perfect Warp 5.0.

Perfect Warp 4.0: Auto warp script version Perfect Warp 3.0.

Perfect Warp 5.0: Auto warp script based on warp bar notches and its respective coordinates.

Perfect Warp 6.0 Auto warp script with a new method.
