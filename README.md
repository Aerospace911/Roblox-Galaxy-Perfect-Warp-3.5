# Roblox Galaxy Perfect Warp (Legal Version)
With Yname's blessing, I now present to you, Perfect Warp 3.0. The legal version of Perfect Warp that I have developed in AHK, is a macro-scripting language. This script inputs the distance you want to warp, then it places a line over the warp bar indicating how far to charge warp for a Perfect Warp.

Perfect Auto Warps do exist however, I have chosen not to release them because it would make Yname unhappy.

## Version Summary
Perfect Warp 1.0: Had a very crude and rudimentary auto warp formula

Perfect Warp 2.0: Had a more refined and perfect auto warp formula

Perfect Warp 3.0: Had a new warp formula and 

Perfect Warp 4.0: I forgor

Perfect Warp 5.0: Auto warp with a different warp formula method

Perfect Warp 6.0 Auto warp with a different warp formula method

### NOTICE 
The script does not work out of the box. There is a setup required with the additional programs included.
