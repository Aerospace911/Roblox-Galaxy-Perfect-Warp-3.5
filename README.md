# Roblox Galaxy Perfect Warp (Legal Version)
With Yname's blessing, I now present to you, Perfect Warp 3.0. The legal version of Perfect Warp that I have developed in AHK. Which is a macro-scripting language. This script takes user input of the distance you want to warp, then it places a line over the warp bar indicating how far to charge warp for a Perfect Warp.

Perfect Auto Warps do exist however, I have chosen not to release them because it would make Yname unhappy.

## Version Summary
Perfect Warp 1.0: Had a very crude and rudimentary auto warp formula

Perfect Warp 2.0: Upgraded auto warp formula from Perfect Warp 1.0

Perfect Warp 3.0: Had a new warp formula and 

Perfect Warp 4.0: I forgor

Perfect Warp 5.0: Auto warp with a different warp formula method

Perfect Warp 6.0 Auto warp with a different warp formula method

# Pros and Cons
### Pros
* The script tells you how far to warp

### Cons
* The script is limited to one monitor/window size.
* Roblox Window must focused during the warp charge
